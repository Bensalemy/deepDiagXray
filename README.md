# deepDiagXray
We are deepDiagXray, a group of professionals and university researchers. We are participating in a European initiative: #EUvsVirus, a hackaton organized by the European Commission, with the aim of identifying innovative solutions to respond to the COVID-19 emergency.  In the last few weeks we have observed and studied the data relating to the X-ray images. We can early detect the COVID 19. And with an application software we can automatically identify the disease vs others using deep learning. To play our role in this huge global emergency we ideated a solution to valuate the possibility to identify the severe symptoms of covid-19. We would reach this goal creating an application\online if possible tool aimed to:  - Share all the info on the correlation mentioned above - Make doctors able to test online and identify COVID 19  - Mitigate and reduce the risk of contamination.  The app, based on machine learning algorithms and data provided by WHO and CDC, is designed to indicate the level of risk of developing severe symptoms in COVID-19 disease.
